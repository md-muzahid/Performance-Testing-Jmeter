Dear Sir, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 27 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2000.
505 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 29 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2020.
506 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 24 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2024.


While executed 506 concurrent request, found  534 request got connection timeout and error rate is 26.38%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 505 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
